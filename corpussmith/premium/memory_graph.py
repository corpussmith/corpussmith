"""Premium seam — persistent cross-project research graph.

Maintains a long-lived knowledge graph across every Corpus Smith project
on the machine: shared authors, recurring subjects, claims seen in
multiple places, papers that keep coming up. Freemium exposes the
contract; the paid build ships the storage + query engine.
